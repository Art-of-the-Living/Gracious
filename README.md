## A Collection of Cognitive Operations

Gracious is a collection of operators for the construction of the cognitive systems which give rise to consciousness.
While these systems are inspired by their biological implementations in the human brain, this is not meant to be
neuro-biological simulation.  Furthermore, while the behaviour of these systems may exhibit properties of a
"learning machine" this is not a machine learning framework. There is no back-propagation or gradient descent.
Instead, Gracious rests, fundamentally, on Hebbian learning with bipolar association between distributed signal
representations.

## The Approach

The theory behind Gracious is largely based on the works of Dr. Pentti O. Haikonen. Dr. Haikonen developed the Haikonen
Associative Neuron and the Haikonen Cognitive Architecture which Gracious structures are largely inspired by. Several
modifications have been made to Dr. Haikonen's designs. Dynamic neuron groups and an optimized 3:1 Hebbian learning have
been added in the name of improved computational efficiency. These modifications have maintained there efficacy and are
comparable in output. Other modifications, including simulated architecture and bipolar associations have been
added to improve on Dr. Haikonen's original designs. Descriptions of all the Gracious terms and their implications are
available in the [docs](docs) under [theory](docs/theory). These concepts are not critical to the high-level operation
of Gracious simulations. 

However, unlike Dr. Haikonen, the **Art of the Living** believes minds simulated on a computer are both possible and
equally valid in every way to those achieved in hardware. Implementing these designs in software provides faster
construction and testing of these systems, and, most importantly, the capacity for native integration with traditional
digital representations of data. While hardware, or wetware, systems may be vastly more efficient when compared to
simulation, this is only a meaningful argument once such systems are feasible. As for now, the super-massive
computational capacity available to mankind must suffice.
