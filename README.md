## A Cognitive Simulation Framework

Gracious is a simulation framework for the cognitive systems which give rise to consciousness. While these systems are
inspired by their biological implementations in the human brain, this is not meant to be neuro-biological simulation.
Furthermore, while the behaviour of these systems may exhibit properties of a "learning machine" this is not a machine
learning framework. Gracious cognitive simulations utilize bipolar associations and optimized Hebbian learning to form
associative relationships between phenomenal appearances and internal states.
